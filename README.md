# Research_Assistant_Crypto
This folder contains my answers to the questions for the Research assistant in crypto role in the file Research_Assistant_Crypto_Lawson_Adesayo.pdf . 
I wrote the answer to the programming question in python 3 because i do not fully understand either C/C++ or golang but i am willing to learn. 
I have also uploaded a sample of my code in proth_function.py for the examiner to test my code. 
Thank you for your consideration
