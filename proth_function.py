def proth_prime_test(proth_number,max_testing_value=1000000):
    """ Description of function:
    This function takes in a proth number and evaluates if it is a proth prime or not using proth theorem which states:

    A proth number 'p' is a proth prime if there exists an integer 'a' for which

        (a^(p-1/2))â‰¡ -1 (mod p)

    which can be given as:

        (a^(p-1/2))+1 must be completely divisible by p
    
                or
    
        (a^(p-1/2))+1 mod p = 0
    
    Parameters:
    proth_number(int): this is the proth number 
    max_testing_value(int): this is the maximum range value for integer 'a' , default value is set at 1000000

    Returns:
    None
